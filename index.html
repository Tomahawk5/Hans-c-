        <strong><p>War Thunder is a free-to-play vehicular combat multiplayer video game developed and published by Gaijin Entertainment. Announced in 2011, it was first released in November 2012 as an open beta with a worldwide release in January 2013; it had its official release on 21 December 2016.[11][7] It has a cross-platform format for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Shield Android TV.

            Developed as a "flying simulation game", it was previously named World of Planes but due to its similarity with Wargaming's World of Warplanes it was changed to its present name in 2012.[12][13] Initially, Gaijin claimed after the game was announced that it was an April Fools joke before confirming its existence in June that same year.[14]
            
            War Thunder won several awards following its release, winning Best Simulation Game at the Gamescom 2013 Awards as well as winning Best Game, Best Developer, Best Technology and Best Sound at the KRI 2013 Awards.[15][16] In 2019, War Thunder was among the most played games on Steam with over 25,000 concurrent players on Steam only.[17] In 2022 the number of concurrent War Thunder players on Steam only was over 50,000 on average and peaked at 76,204 on March, 31.[18] These numbers do not include players who use consoles or Gaijin.net service for PC. Official website claims[19] that there are 50+ million gamers registered in War Thunder in total.
            
            As of November 1, 2022, War Thunder has over 160,000 concurrent players on all platforms combined and over 70 million registered users.[20]</p></strong>
